# EthroTime-A-Framework-for-Perceptual-Time-in-VR
The Ethro Time Theory introduces a mathematical model to describe perceived  time as an integral of a dynamic Ethro Rate r(t), which depends on contextual and physiological variables. The model enables controlled manipulation and measurement of subjective time in virtual and augmented reality, cognitive simulations, and adaptive systems.
